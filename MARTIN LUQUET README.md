Applied Improvements
I made all the changes I considered necessary to improve the codebase, focusing on maintainability, performance, and scalability

1. Code Structure & Maintainability
Refactored and cleaned up the code: Removed unnecessary complexity and improved readability.

Singleton cleanup: Removed all singletons except for GameHandler and GameResources to keep a controlled global state.

Assembly Definitions: Created assembly definition files to reduce compilation time and clearly separate concerns.

2. Performance Optimizations
Object Pooling: Implemented pooling for frequently spawned/despawned objects to reduce allocations and GC spikes.

Removed frequent GetComponent calls: Cached required components to avoid repeated lookups during gameplay.

Separated systems (e.g., Food System): Modularized systems for better performance tracking and easier maintenance.

3. Scalability & Flexibility
AssetBundles Implementation:
Added the ability to load seasonal content on demand (e.g., Halloween skins) without requiring a new build.

Creation: Tools/Martin Luquet/Build AssetBundles

Loading: From the Loading scene, select the LoaderCallback GameObject and click Load AssetBundles.
Parameters can be adjusted from there.

Decoupled systems: All systems are now flexible, scalable, and testable.

4. Testing
Unit Tests: Added to validate the sound manager system as an example for Unit Testing.

5. User Interface
UI Rework: Completely rebuilt all views from scratch for consistency and easier customization.

6. Input Handling
Input System: Migrated to Unityâ€™s (old) Input System to support both keyboard/mouse and controllers for console compatibility.

Virtual D-Pad: Added for mobile touch control support.

Why these were prioritized
Maintainability: Cleaning the architecture and removing redundant singletons improves long-term scalability.

Performance: Object pooling and caching reduce frame-time spikes, which is critical for a smooth player experience.

Extensibility: AssetBundles allow adding seasonal or special event content without rebuilding the entire game.

Portability: Improved input handling and UI design enable seamless deployment across PC, mobile, and console.

Testability: Unit tests ensure future modifications do not break existing functionality.
